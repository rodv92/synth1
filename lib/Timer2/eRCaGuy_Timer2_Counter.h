**Basic Summary**
"I wrote a libary to get 0.5us precision on a "micros()" replacement function, so that I can get repeatable results reading a PWM or PPM signal, to within 1us.  I searched all around the internet and could not find something comparable (or that was easy to use, and maintained the Arduino's ability to write PWM signals via the Servo Libary), so I think this is my first real contribution to the world of Arduino and Radio Control."

 Version: 1.0 - first release as an actual Library (instead of just an appended file) - 13 May 2014
 
FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE THE .CPP FILE.

GS: *************NOTE TO SELF************: I referred to the TimerOne Library (http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Timer1) in order to figure
    out how to make ISR() work within a library. Ultimately, I ended up using the library object pre-instantiation method so that I could
	call a specific object method within the library itself.  See the .cpp file, and the ISR() therein, for details.
